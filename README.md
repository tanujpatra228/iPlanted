# 🌳 Welcome to iPlanted: Our Journey to a Greener Future! 🌍

🔥 As India faced the hottest summer this year, it's time to take action! In this exciting new series, we're creating iPlanted, a platform where you can mark locations on a map where you've planted a tree, sapling, or seed. Let's make our #ActOfPlanting count and help cool our planet!

🚀 What to Expect:

- Building a web app using the latest Next.js (Next.js 14), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and TypeScript.
- Utilizing React Leaflet and OpenStreetMap for seamless map handling and display.
- Step-by-step process for buying and connecting a domain with hosting.

🌱 Join the Movement:

I invite you to participate by planting something green and adding a marker for it on iPlanted. Let's create a digital map of our collective effort to make the world a greener place!
